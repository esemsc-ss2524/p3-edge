Task:
Build an autonomous home shopping agent that revolutionizes household management by
leveraging AI to track inventory, predict needs, and execute seamless orders—empowering
users with smarter, privacy-first grocery shopping.
Create innovative AI agents that act as personal shopping assistants
for the home. Drawing from real-world data sources like smart appliances and user inputs, your
project should automate the tedious parts of grocery shopping while putting control firmly in the user's
hands. 

This bounty track rewards projects that build functional prototypes of an AI-Robot Shopping Assistant,
focusing on groceries via Amazon and Walmart integrations. Your agent should intelligently manage
household needs, learn from user behavior, and operate with robust privacy safeguards. Whether
you're enhancing inventory tracking or fine-tuning preference-based recommendations, we're looking
for solutions that make everyday shopping effortless and efficient.

Requirements
To qualify, your submission must meet these core standards—ensuring a working MVP that
aligns with the theme:
1. Core Functionality: Implement inventory tracking (e.g., via smart-fridge/pantry APIs or
simulated data), need prediction (using simple ML models), and order placement with user
approval flows for Amazon and Walmart.
2. Inputs Integration: Support at least two input sources, such as receipt/email scans (via OCR
or API parsing) and manual edits through a simple UI.
3. Actions & Controls: Include run-out forecasting, cart building with brand preferences, and
controls like spend caps, vendor allowlists, approval modes, and an audit log.
4. Privacy Focus: Demonstrate encrypted data handling, user-owned storage, and on-device
processing (e.g., via edge ML libraries).
5. MVP Scope: Limit to groceries only; include live demos of Amazon/Walmart API integrations
(use sandbox/test accounts).

Not Allowed
Keep your project focused and ethical—avoid these pitfalls:
1. No mockups, PPTs, or non-functional prototypes; must be a runnable MVP.
2. No expansions beyond groceries (e.g., no clothing or electronics).
3. No hard-coded orders without user approval simulations.
4. No use of real user data without explicit consent mocks; prioritize synthetic testing.
5. No integrations outside Amazon/Walmart for the MVP.
6. Incomplete privacy measures (e.g., unencrypted logs) will disqualify.
